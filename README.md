Very basic and not meant to do much of anything. It's a familiarization with Python. Documentation what is being learned from experimentation here.

Single quotes inside double quotes is fine. Double quotes inside single quotes is fine. But it's easier to remain that way instead of adding the backslashes for the double quotes inside double quotes.

Adding a \n in the middle of a print statement would add a new line break on its own but don't add any extra space immediately after typing the \n.

When concatenating, add a space character to the end or beginning of the strings being concatenated.

IndentationError will appear if the/an indentation is unnecessary and needs to be eliminated from the area/line number of the code the IndetnationError flag was thrown up for.

Red swiggle line, like anyhwere else, is an indication of the line having an error that needs to be remedied immediately. Greatly helps in the debugging process but also helps bring attention to something that needs to be debugged right then so it doesn't need to be came back to later.

Input v Print: print will end the program when it has finsihed printing what was in the quotes. Input will be waiting with a cursor for you to type something in in order to continue to complete the program. However print and input can be nested inside of each other.

Use the symbol # to make a comment. To turn an entire line into a comment, push on control and forwardslash at the same time on the line desired to be commented.

Got many TypeErrors and cannot understand why yet when attempting concatenation. will keep playing around and see where I went wrong.
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'

*Figured out where I went wrong! Turns out I nested wrong! After doing a bit of course correcting with variaable nesting, I was able to get it to deliver the input desired results. Now I need to figure out why the space characters I keep trying to add aren't appearing in the final terminal production.*

*Officially figured out a way around that spacing character issue! Booyah!*

You can name variables whatever you want, including multiple names and with numbers, but they need to be separated by an underscore to avoid a SyntaxError.
